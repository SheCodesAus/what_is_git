## 1.0 - Git
Git is a "version control" tool. This means we can use it to keep track of and manage changes that we make to our code. 

Git lets us safely try out modifications to code, without losing the version that works. It also allows us to "stitch together" all the best bits from various versions of our software. 

This might sound a bit abstract, so let's work through an example together.

### 1.1 - Some Housekeeping
If you followed the instructions in our first ever lesson to the letter, you will have created a conveniently-located folder to hold your classwork. Let's check that it exists now:

#### 1.1.1 - Go To Your Home Directory
Open the terminal, and issue the following command:

```bash
cd ~
```

> [!Note]  
> That squiggly line is called a "tilde" (pronounced "til-duh"). You can type it by holding `Shift`, and then pressing the button next to the number 1 at the top of your keyboard.

This command navigates you to your "home" directory. That's the directory set aside for your personal files and folders.

#### 1.1.2 - Make Sure You Have A Classwork Directory
Now enter this command:

```bash
ls
```

This will print the contents of your home directory on the screen. You should see a directory listed among them called `she_codes/`. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you don't see one, you can create it now with:
>
> ```bash
> mkdir she_codes
> ```

#### 1.1.3 - Navigate Into Your Classwork Directory
Now that we're certain that your `she_codes` directory exists, navigate into it with this command:

```bash
cd she_codes
```

#### 1.1.4 - Create A Directory For Today's Work
We need a directory to hold our work for this lesson. You can create one and simultaneously navigate into it by entering the following command:

```bash
mkdir git_and_github && cd $_
```

> [!Note]  
> `$_` is a little trick to let us avoid typing `git_and_github` twice. It is like saying "use that last value that I gave you again" to the shell. 
> 
> So this command says: "create a directory called `git_and_github`, and then immediately change directory into that same folder".

You should now be here:
```
~/
|
â”œâ”€ she_codes/
| |
| â”œâ”€git_and_github/   <--- You are here
```

Ok, we are now ready to begin! What we just did is a good way to begin any class where we work on a new project. Jump to your classword directory, and then make a new folder to hold the code for that project.

### 1.2 - Initialisation

We are going to turn our `git_and_github/` directory into a "Git Repository". That's what we call a directory that is version controlled with Git. 

This is another good thing to do each time we start work on something new.

To initialise the repo, you can run the following command:

```bash
git init
```

This "initialises" the folder as a Git repo. 

You can check that it worked by listing the contents of the current directory with this command:

```bash
ls -A
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The `-A` there is a "flag". It adds optional extra functionality to the command. In this case, we are asking the shell to list ALL of the contents of the current directory, including hidden files and folders.

Here's what you should see:

![The terminal, with an output that just says `.git/`](./img/ls_results.png)

Hidden files and directories have names that begin with a dot. We can see that Git has created a hidden directory for us called `.git/`. This directory stores all the files that Git uses for keeping track of changes to our files. We don't need to open it right now - Git will handle it for us.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We **won't** be working *inside* the `.git/` directory. It is just there to let Git do its thing. We will be creating all of the files and folders we need inside the `git_and_github/` directory, and `.git/` will just sit there alongside them. Watching. Waiting. ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€

> [!WARNING]  
> Try to avoid a situation where one Git repo gets created *inside another one*. This can cause some very weird and confusing problems. 
> 
> In general, you want to keep all the files for each project inside one "umbrella" directory, and make that umbrella directory your git repo. When you start a new project, make a new umbrella directory for it, next to your other projects. Like this:
>
> ```
> she_codes/
> â”œâ”€ html_intro/
> â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.html
> â”‚  â”œâ”€ styles.css
> |
> â”œâ”€ git_and_github/        <--- This is a git repo!
> â”‚  â”œâ”€ README.md
> â”‚  â”œâ”€ .git/
> |
> â”œâ”€ profile_site_project/  <--- This is a git repo!
> â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.html
> â”‚  â”œâ”€ styles.css
> â”‚  â”œâ”€ README.md
> â”‚  â”œâ”€ .git/
> ```

### 1.3 - The Initial Commit
Git handles changes that we make to our files by storing them in "commits". Each commit represents a set of changes - a bit like a snapshot of our progress. 

We need to create an initial commit, so that we have a "starting point" to build on for our future changes. 

#### 1.3.1 - Create A Blank File
Let's create a blank file to be in our initial commit. Run the following command:

```bash
touch README.md
```

> [!INFO]  
> The `touch` command creates a new file with the name supplied.

Now open the current directory in VS Code like so:

```bash
code .
```

Here's what you should see:

![A blank file called `README.md` in VS Code](./img/blank_file.png)

#### 1.3.2 - Check The Status
We won't be adding any code yet - we'll let our initial commit just contain a blank file. Jump back into the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git status
```

Here's what you should see:

![The results of running `git status` in the terminal - `README.md` is marked as an untracked file.](./img/initial_status.png)

So, Git can see that we have created a new file in the repository, but it isn't yet keeping track of those changes. If we want to add them to a commit, we need to put them in Git's "staging area". This is a holding zone for the changes we add to our commits.

#### 1.3.2 - Add The New File To The "Staging Area"
To stage changes to a file, we use the `git add` command. Give it a go:

```bash
git add README.md
```

Now try checking the status again:

```bash
git status
```

![The results of running `git status` in the terminal - `README.md` is now marked as a change to be committed.](./img/second_status.png)

Looking good!

#### 1.3.3 - Make The Commit
We are now ready to make our first commit! Here's the command:

```bash
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The `-m` flag lets us add a "commit message" - a little explanation of what changes are in this commit. The text inside the quotation marks is the message. It's important to supply a message every time - Git will make your life difficult if you don't.

Here's the result of running that command:

![The result of creating our first commit.](./img/initial_commit.png)

Nice! We have a blank canvas to build on now. 

### 1.4 - A Second Commit
#### 1.4.1 - Adding Some Code
Let's make a real change now. Go back to VS Code, add some text to `README.md`, and save the file. Here's a suggestion for what you can add:

```md
# Git Demonstration
Here are some useful commands for Git:
* `git init`: initialises a directory as a Git repo
* `git status`: checks the status of a Git repo
* `git add some_file_name`: adds `some_file_name` to staging
* `git commit -m "some message"`: creates a Git commit with "some message" as the commit message 
```

Don't forget to save the file!

> [!NOTE]  
> The code we have added is in a language called "Markdown". It's quite extremely useful, and we will see it again in this course. Luckily, Markdown is so close to normal English that we don't need to be familiar with it to understand what's being said here.

#### 1.4.1 - Check The Status Again
Let's check the status again! 

```bash
git status
```

![The results of running `git status` a third time. This time there are more unstaged changes to `README.md`.](./img/third_status.png)

Our new changes have been noticed by Git, but once again they aren't automatically staged. This is good, because sometimes there will be new changes that we don't want to add to our next commit! In this case, though, we **do** want to include this change in our next commit, so...

#### 1.4.2 - Add To Staging Again
Add that change to staging! Same command as before:

```bash
git add README.md
```

Just to prove that it worked, let's check the status again. You don't need to do this every time, but it's a good demonstration for now:

```bash
git status
```

![The results of running status yet again. This time the changes to our file have been added to staging.](./img/second_staging.png)

Note that before our staged changes were marked with `new file:`, whereas now they register as `modified:`. Git is savvy!

#### 1.4.3 - Make That Commit!
Ok, let's make our second commit. This time we need to include a different message:

```bash
git commit -m "added some useful hints on how to use Git to the README"
```

![The results of our second Git commit. This time the commit notes that 6 insertions were made.](./img/second_commit.png)

### 1.5 - Taking Stock
Let's just take a look at what we've done so far. In the pre-work video entitled "What Is Git", you were shown a graph that looked like this, depicting some commits:

![Three commits represented as a graph.](./img/what_is_git_video/7_graph_head.drawio.png)

We can't get quite such a pretty representation in the terminal, but we can get close. Try running this command:

```bash
git log --graph
```

Here's what I see:

![The Git graph, represented in the command line. Two commits are represented by asterisks, tagged with details describing them, and linked by a dotted line.](./img/git_log.png)

This is pretty much what we had above - it has just been rotated by 90 degrees, and rendered as text-art. The initial commit is at the bottom, and our second commit is above it. Each commit is represented by an asterisk. 

Of course, the working tree isn't represented in our command line graph. But the working tree is just "the current state of our code", and we can see that by looking at the files in VS Code!

Not bad!

> [!NOTE]  
> In the "What Is Git" video, we mentioned that Git can be used to revert a previous mistake. We won't be demonstrating that here, because we don't want to get bogged down. If you'd like to see a demo of that (plus some other helpful techniques), [take a look at our video on useful Git techniques]().

### 1.6 - Create A Feature Branch
We've got some good progress in our repo here. We'd like to add some more, but we don't want to risk breaking what we already have by adding untested new code.

We've only been operating on the main branch so far. Let's create a new branch to hold our new changes. Once we are happy with them, we can merge them in.

A branch that we create to add new content or functionality to our code is called a "feature branch". In this case the feature that we're adding will just be more text in the `README.md` file, but that's ok! From little things, big things grow.

#### 1.6.1 - Create The New Branch
Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git branch my_new_branch
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Here `my_new_branch` is the name we are giving to our new branch!

#### 1.6.2 - Take A Look At The Current Branches
Just so we are orientated, let's see what branches we have right now. To do this, you can run this command:

```bash
git branch
```

Since we didn't supply the name of a new branch, Git will just list all the currently available branches for us.

![A list of current branches in the terminal. There are two: `main`, and `my_new_branch`.](./img/current_branches.png)

The asterisk here indicates that we are currently operating on the `main` branch. If we want to work on our new feature in the other branch, we'll need to change that...

#### 1.6.3 - Check Out The New Branch
When we swap to a different branch in Git, we call it "checking out" the branch. We can do it with the following command:

```bash
git checkout my_new_branch
```

### 1.7 - Develop A Feature

#### 1.7.1 - Write The Code
Hope back over to VS Code. You should see the same contents in the `README.md` file as you did before, since right now our two branches are identical to one another. 

Let's change that. Here's a modification to make to the file:

```diff
# Git Demonstration
Here are some useful commands for Git:
* `git init`: initialises a directory as a Git repo
* `git status`: checks the status of a Git repo
* `git add some_file_name`: adds `some_file_name` to staging
* `git commit -m "some message"`: creates a Git commit with "some message" as the commit message 

+ Some more commands:
+ * `git log --graph`: displays a graph of the commits in your repo
+ * `git branch`: lists the current branches in your repo
+ * `git branch some_branch_name`: creates a new branch called "some_branch_name"
+ * `git checkout some_branch_name`: moves the HEAD to the most recent commit on the branch called "some_branch_name"
```

#### 1.7.2 - Stage The Changes
You can use `git status` to check what files have changed if you'd like. That's a good idea when you've made complex changes or it has been a while since your last commit.

In this case, though, we know exactly what has changed, and there's only one file we need to stage. So let's run that command:

```bash
git add README.md
```

#### 1.7.3 - Make The Commit
This should be getting familiar! Here's that command again, this time with a different commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "added some extra examples of git commands to the readme"
```

The state of our branches now looks something like this:

![A diagram showing the "my_new_branch" branch forking off from the "main" branch.](./img/before_merge.drawio.png)

> We're showing it to you in this format because the Git log graph doesn't draw lines where there are no commits. So it won't show you the forking path, since the `main` branch hasn't has any commits since the one marked with a blue circle here.
>
> You can still take a look at the Git graph, it'll just be a bit less helpful.

### 1.8 - Merge The Feature Branch Into Main
Go time! Our "feature" is complete, and we are happy with how it looks, so let's merge it into the "canonical" version of our code - the `main` branch.

#### 1.8.1 - Check Out The Main Branch
To start with, we have to jump back to the `main` branch, since we want to merge our changes into it. 

You can do that with this command:

```bash
git checkout main
```

#### 1.8.2 - Merge Away!
Ok, time to merge. Here's the command for that:

```bash
git merge my_new_branch
```

Here's what you should see:

![The result of the merge - the readout says "1 file changed, 7 insertions, 1 deletion".](./img/merge.png)
